When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm collaborating with someone who is working on a network seperate from mine, or 
when I'd like a copy of the work to be stored in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
An automatic update could publish commits that include incomplete features on the GitHub site,
thus moving allowing others to pull incomplete projects before they're ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?
A fork is a clone that's run on GitHub's servers instead of locally.  A clone is a copy of 
a repo.  A branch is a split of a project used to experiment with new features and such.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It limits the number of potential conflict when updating the project (?)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, adn what
would be harder?
Emailing shared files or posting them to a shared drive or similar (e.g. SharePoint).
It would be much harder because it would require MUCH more communication.  It would only
be easier because the extra communication would decrease the likelihood of an error in 
that way (though it would increase the likelihood of other errors).
