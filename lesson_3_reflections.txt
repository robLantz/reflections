When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm collaborating with someone who is working on a network seperate from mine, or 
when I'd like a copy of the work to be stored in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
An automatic update could publish commits that include incomplete features on the GitHub site,
thus moving allowing others to pull incomplete projects before they're ready.
