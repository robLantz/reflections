What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
do it?
When you initialize a repo it creates the necessary meta-data files
that will hold history and branch information.  We need to initialize
in order to create those things so git can update on commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where you place things that will go into a 
single commit, while the working directory is the native file system, and 
the repository is where the commits end up.  The staging area allows you
to commit multiple files at one time.
